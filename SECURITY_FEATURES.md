# 🔒 Security & Data Protection - Comprehensive Guide

## 🛡️ Overview

Your health data is among the most sensitive information you have. This platform implements **military-grade security measures** to ensure your information remains private, secure, and accessible only to authorized individuals.

---

## 🔐 Core Security Principles

### 1. **Defense in Depth**
Multiple layers of security protect your data:
- Network security (firewalls, DDoS protection)
- Application security (input validation, secure coding)
- Data security (encryption, access controls)
- Physical security (secure data centers)
- Human security (training, policies)

### 2. **Zero Trust Architecture**
- Never trust, always verify
- Every access request is authenticated and authorized
- Minimal privilege principle (least access necessary)
- Continuous monitoring and validation

### 3. **Privacy by Design**
- Security built into every feature from day one
- Data minimization (collect only what's needed)
- Transparent data practices
- User control over personal information

## 🔑 Authentication & Access Control

### **Password Security**
```
✅ Bcrypt Password Hashing (Salt Rounds: 12)
   - Passwords NEVER stored in plain text
   - Unique salt for each password
   - Computationally expensive to crack
   - Industry-standard algorithm

✅ Password Requirements
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Mix of uppercase and lowercase
   - Numbers and special characters
   - Not in common password database

✅ Password Reset
   - Secure token generation
   - Time-limited reset links (15 minutes)
   - Email verification required
   - Old password immediately invalidated
```

### **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
```
✅ Stateless Authentication
   - Cryptographically signed tokens
   - Cannot be tampered with
   - Expire after 24 hours
   - Refresh token rotation

✅ Token Structure
   - Header: Algorithm & Token Type
   - Payload: User ID, Role, Permissions
   - Signature: Verification Hash
   - Stored securely (httpOnly cookies)

✅ Token Validation
   - Every API request validates token
   - Expired tokens automatically rejected
   - Revocation list for compromised tokens
```

### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
```
✅ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
   - Time-based OTP (TOTP)
   - QR code enrollment
   - Backup codes for recovery
   - SMS fallback option

✅ Biometric Options
   - Fingerprint authentication
   - Face recognition
   - Device-based authentication
```

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```

## 🔐 Data Encryption

### **Encryption at Rest**
```javascript
Algorithm: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard)
Key Size: 256 bits (virtually unbreakable)
Mode: GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)

What's Encrypted:
✅ Health Records (diagnoses, treatments, symptoms)
✅ Vital Signs (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.)
✅ Prescriptions (medications, dosages)
✅ Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
✅ Medical Notes & Doctor Observations
✅ Lab Results & Test Reports
✅ Insurance Information
✅ Emergency Contacts

Encryption Process:
1. Generate unique IV (Initialization Vector) per record
2. Encrypt data with AES-256-GCM
3. Store: encrypted data + IV + auth tag
4. Decryption only with valid credentials
```

**Example (Simplified):**
```javascript
// Before Encryption (Plain Text)
{
  diagnosis: "Type 2 Diabetes",
  symptoms: ["Increased thirst", "Frequent urination"],
  bloodSugar: 180
}

// After Encryption (What's Stored)
{
  encryptedData: "7a8f3d9e...c4b2a1f8",
  iv: "9d4c3b2a...8e7f6d5c",
  authTag: "3f9e8d7c...b2a1c0f9"
}
// Completely unreadable without decryption key!
```

### **Encryption in Transit**
```
✅ HTTPS/TLS 1.3
   - All communications encrypted
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Perfect forward secrecy
   - Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

✅ Secure WebSocket Connections
   - Real-time notifications encrypted
   - WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol

✅ API Security
   - Bearer token authentication
   - CORS restrictions
   - Rate limiting per endpoint
```

### **Key Management**
```
✅ Encryption Keys
   - Stored in secure environment variables
   - Never committed to code repository
   - Rotated periodically (every 90 days)
   - Hardware Security Module (HSM) backed

✅ Key Access
   - Limited to server environment only
   - No client-side key exposure
   - Separate keys for different data types
   - Audit trail for key usage
```

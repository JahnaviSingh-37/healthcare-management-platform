*Imagine: Like Pokemon cards appearing one by one, each popping up with a little bounce. When you hover, they float up like magic!*

### **Doctor Selection:**
*Imagine: Click a doctor card and it does a 360° spin while turning purple. A big checkmark appears with a "pop" sound effect (silent but looks like it!).*

### **Success Screen:**

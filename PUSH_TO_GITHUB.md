## 🔑 Authentication Options

When pushing, you'll need to authenticate. Choose one:

### Option A: Personal Access Token (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Name: `Healthcare Platform`
3. Expiration: `90 days` (or your choice)
4. Scopes: Check **`repo`** (all repo access)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. When pushing, use:
   - Username: `JahnaviSingh-37`
   - Password: `paste_your_token_here`

### Option B: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
